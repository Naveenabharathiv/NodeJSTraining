How to 'Love Your Neighbor As Yourself' as in Mark 12:31
-> For the entire law is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Galatians 5:14)
-> Keep on loving one another as brothers and sisters. Do not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it. (Hebrews 13:1-2)
-> Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves. (Philippians 2:3)
-> A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. (John 13:34)
-> The commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not covet,” and whatever other commands there may be, are summed up in this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” (Romans 13:9)
